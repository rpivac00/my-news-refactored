# my-news-refactored
Refactored MyNews React app

Various bug fixes & performance improvements made
- Context
- Saving and retrieving favourites from local storage
- Implemented debounce function in latest news widget to prevent multiple fetch requests
- Improved responsivity

The app is deployed on netlify: https://my-news-refactored-rpivac00.netlify.app/

*Latest news widget and search don't work on Netlify because NewsApi is forbidding requests.*
